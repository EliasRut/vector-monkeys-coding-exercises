# Coding Session 2, Group 2
This session is all about solving some coding exercises in JavaScript.

## Getting started
Before you start solving the exercises, you will need to pull them to your local computer.
To do that, we will use git clone. This will generate a new directory inside the one you are currently in.

Navigate to where you want to generate this repository by using your console and the cd command.

Once you are where you want to be, run
```
git clone https://github.com/EliasRut/cs-group2-session2.git
```

## Installing dependencies
The next thing you will want to do is install the nodejs dependencies. These are only required for
running the tests.

To do that, go into your newly generated directory by using cd, and then run
```
npm install
```

## Switching to your branch
Since everybody should be working on their own solution, let's all switch to a separate git branch.

You can do this by executing
```
git checkout -b YOUR_USERNAME
```

## Running the tests
You can now start implementing your solutions. If you want to see whether they are correct, just run
the tests that are included in exercises.test.js. To do so, just run
```
npm run test
```
